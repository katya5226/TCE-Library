Device dimensions: thickness in off state is approximately 1.5 mm
Working  approx. 29 cm^2.

External stimuli: the current through the film is around 300 mA, the voltage actuation is 100 V.
So we estimate the input power to be a few Watts. ~10W

k_On ~ 3x10^-5 W/mK
k_Off ~ 0.003 W/mK

Operation range: Unknown, probably around RT

Effective density: ~730 kg/m^3
Effective specific heat capacity: ~920 J/kg/K
