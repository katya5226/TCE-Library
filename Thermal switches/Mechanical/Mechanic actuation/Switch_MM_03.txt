The exact dimensions are not known but we estimate that the thickness of the switch should be a few cm.

Operating range is estimated to be 273-373 K.

k_eff_On ~ 0.6 W/m/K (Water; estimated)
k_eff_Off ~ 0.06 W/m/K (Air + water; estimated)

Thermal resistivity can be tuned.

Response time is probably a few seconds.

Actuation input power unknown.

Effective density and specific heat capacity unknown. The values of 1000 kg/m^3 and 1000 J/kg/K will be used.
