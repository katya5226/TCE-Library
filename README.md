# TCE-Library
Library of already built thermal control elements.
It is the adjoint library of our open-source tool for modelling thermal control elements and thermal control circuits, TCCbuilder (https://github.com/katya5226/TCCbuilderApp).

Researchers around the world are kindly invited to contribute to the library.
See the examples in the library to prepare the data files for the TCEs that you would like to add.
Sent the files to katja.vozel@fs.uni-lj.si for review. After accepting the files, we will add them to the library.
