Diode/Regulator (PNIPAM/PDMS)

Cross section area: diameter ~15 mm
Length: 2 x ~7 mm

Forward configuration: PNIPAM is heated
Reverse configuration: PDMS is heated

Critical temperature: 305 K

Hot side temperature range: 303 K < T < 318 K

Switching ratio: up to 4

Switching time: not known, probably seconds

k_forward = 0.2 W/m/K

k_reverse = 0.1 W/m/K

k_eff = approx 0.1 W/m/K below transition temperature

PNIPAM: density = 1100 kg/m3, cp = 7400 J/kg/K (source: Google, polymerdatabase.com)
PDMS: density = 965 kg/m3, cp = 1000 J/kg/K (source: Google)

Effective density = 1030 kg/m^3
Effective specific heat capacity = 4200 J/kg/K
