The diode was contained in a square 5 mm x 5 mm glass tube that was 20 mm long in the direction of the heat ?ux and had a 1.0 mm wall thickness.

Rectification factor is between ~1 at temperature bias of 30 K and ~1.4 at temperature bias of 50 K.

Operating range: 283 - 333 K

k_forward ~ 6 W/m/K
k_reverse ~ 2.5 W/m/K

The response time is probably around 1 s.

Effective density: ~13700 kg/m^3
Effective specific heat capacity: ~140 kg/m^3
